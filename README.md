# PhaserJS Typescript Template

This is a project template for building games with [PhaserJS](https://phaser.io/).

## Features

* TypeScript
* Webpack
* Live Reload
* PWA on production builds

## Usage

* [ ] game assets can be dropped into the `/static` directory
* [ ] override favicons in the `/favicon` directory
* [ ] if updating the phaserjs library, and the typescript definitions are not included, then remember to [download the latest definitions from phaser's doc site](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-docs/tree/master/typescript)

## Todo

* [ ] Do not copy the `phaser.d.ts` from the docs site.  (currently it is not published)
* [ ] Improve bootstrapping process
